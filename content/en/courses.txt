[- We also engage in technical group projects, which cultivate teamwork and long-term project planning. These experiences teach us to adapt to unforeseen challenges and collaborate effectively in distributed environments. Here are some of the major projects I have contributed to:]
{|
  == Distributed Application in Java <em>- Second year of engineering school, 2025</em> ==
  The objective was to design a system that extends a Java server by implementing mobile agents across a network. \\
  Based on =>https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/320385.320415<<this paper>>, we conducted performance benchmarks against standard RMI (Remote Method Invocation) interactions. \\
  <em>Tech : Java, RMI, Network Sockets, Multithreading, Custom Classloaders</em> ***
}
{|
  == Brick Breaker Game in OCaml <em>- Second year of engineering school, 2025</em> ==
  The goal of this project was to develop a fully functional Brick Breaker game using strictly functional programming principles. \\
  This project was particularly insightful for mastering recursion, immutability, and state management without side effects. \\
  <em>Tech : OCaml, Functional Paradigms, Monads, Algebraic Effects, Flux</em> ***
}
{|
  == Real-Time Ant Simulation in Java <em>- First year of engineering school, 2024</em> ==
  In this open-ended project, we developed a real-time simulation software using Java and Swing. We created an ant colony simulation where users can interact by placing resources or obstacles in real-time. \\
  Working in a team of eight, we implemented Agile methodologies and utilized various collaborative tools to manage the development lifecycle. \\
  <em>Tech : Java, Swing (GUI), JUnit 4 (Testing), Agile (Scrum), GitLab </em> ***
}
{|
  == Timetable Solver in Python <em>- Second year of preparatory school, 2023</em> ==
  The challenge was to generate automated school schedules while satisfying complex constraints, such as teacher availability and classroom capacity. \\
  Developed in Python using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, I took the lead of our eight-person team. This experience provided valuable lessons in team organization and project management. \\
  <em>Tech : Python, Metaheuristics (Simulated Annealing), Algorithmic Optimization </em> ***

Sport and Other Activities
{|
  == Climbing <em>- 4 years</em> ==
  Practicing climbing for four years has instilled in me resilience and the importance of collaboration to overcome technical challenges on difficult routes. \\
  I have also completed ISAE training (Instructor on Artificial Climbing Structures), qualifying me to supervise climbing sessions for diverse audiences. This certification provided me with deep expertise in safety protocols, technical instruction, and pedagogy. \\
  I am currently an active member of the Gr'INP club, where I lead and secure open-access sessions at the climbing gym. ***

  == Organ <em>- 9 years</em> ==
  As an enthusiast of Baroque music, I completed nine years of organ and music theory studies at the Thouars Conservatory. \\
  Performing regularly in public has taught me to manage performance anxiety and maintain peak focus under pressure. ***

  == Scouting <em>- 11 years</em> ==
  Through eleven years of scouting, I developed a profound commitment to teamwork, mutual aid, and collective responsibility. These experiences in nature required constant adaptability and initiative, whether leading a group or working independently. \\
  The leadership roles and field challenges I navigated have shaped my character, fostering a strong sense of reliability and interpersonal cohesion that I bring to every project. ***
